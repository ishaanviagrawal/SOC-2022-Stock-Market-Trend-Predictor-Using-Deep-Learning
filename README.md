# SOC-2022-Stock-Market-Trend-Predictor-Using-Deep-Learning  
This project included learning the basics of Python and its various libraries, the basics of stock markets and trading, and finally reading and implementing a research paper titled "Using Deep Learning Neural Networks and Candlestick Chart Representation to Predict Stock Market"     
## Week-1   
This week consisted of learning the basics of python and stock markets. 
### Assignment-1      
This assignment included building a basic Python Script which goes through the entire text of a particular book and mugs up all its words. After that it asks you for a word, goes over the times when this word came in the text and gives you the complete sentence in which it was used. You may choose to ask for as many such sentences as the number of occurences of the word.  
## Week-2  
This week was spent learning about various basic to advanced python libraries.   
### Assignment-1   
Momentum-based Trading is based on the assumption that Stocks which have performed will in the past, will perform better in the coming future. This program would read the Data from a CSV File, have some class and functions which will help it decide what to buy based on Momentum.  
### Assignment-2
The idea behind pair switching is that if the assets are negatively correlated, then a traditional mixed portfolio might lead to a lower return than the return for the individual assets. We periodically compute the Co-relation Coefficients' Matrix and choose pair of stocks which have the most negative co-relations and trade in them. The basic idea being that if one of them would fall, then the other would rise and hence, we must switch between them. The program would need to first read the Data from DATA.csv, and have some functions which could decide which pairs to choose.
